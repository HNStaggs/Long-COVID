# Long-COVID
Understanding Predictive Factors of Brain Fog in Long-COVID

## Background
Long-COVID is a chronic, multisymptom condition that develops after one or more COVID-19 infections. The diagnostic definition is 12+ weeks since initial infection, one or more new persistent symptoms, and a report of affect on daily functioning. Primary complaints include physical fatigue and brain fog, along with sleep dysfunction and mental health symptoms.
## Methods
In this analysis, various aspects of long-COVID are explored in a sample of 793 people. First, a binary classification model (long-COVID vs. healthy) was trained and tested to identify biopsychosocial features of a long-COVID diagnosis. The input features include the following domains: various types of stress, social support, mental health symptoms, cogntive complaints, physical complaints, health history, pain, and demographics. Second, a regression model was built to look at the subjective and objective features of brain fog severity, while controlling for long-COVID diagnosis and symptom phenotype. Brain fog score was operationalized as a numerical variable by using the global score from the PROMIS Cognitive Complaints measure. Symptom phenotypes were derived from K-means clustering.
